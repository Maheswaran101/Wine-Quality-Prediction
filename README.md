# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical features like acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content. By training models on labeled wine data, it helps classify wines into quality categories, supporting quality control and consumer satisfaction.
